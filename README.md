## Introduction
Plagiarism is an act of fraud. It basically means using someone elseâ€™s words or ideas without giving them proper credit. It is not in itself a crime but can constitute copyright infringement, that's why it's a serious ethical offense. 
Now, it is generally difficult to detect plagiarism, but by leveraging machine learning techniques and NLP, we can create a robust plagiarism detector that can accurately identify copied content. This project walks you through the process of building a plagiarism detector from collecting the dataset to creating a Flask web application for easy use.
There are few available websites which can detect/catch plagiarism. Few of them are www.ithentical.com, www.turnitin.com, www.plagiarism.org, etc.
